Word search

I have developed a project titled "Word Hunt," which serves as a comprehensive dictionary with an integrated text-to-speech feature. This application is designed to facilitate users in efficiently searching for words and obtaining their respective explanations through an audio narration. The technology stack employed in the development of this project includes React.js, HTML, and CSS, enabling a seamless and intuitive user interface.

Additionally, "Word Hunt" is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), offering enhanced user experience and performance. As a PWA, it allows users to access the application from their web browsers without the need for installation, ensuring easy accessibility across various devices and platforms.

The application's primary objective is to provide users with a user-friendly and efficient tool for exploring word meanings, improving language skills, and enhancing overall comprehension. The combination of React.js, HTML, and CSS ensures a modern and visually appealing interface, while the text-to-speech functionality adds an auditory dimension, enriching the user experience.

By employing professional language and fixing grammatical errors, the application aims to cater to a wide range of users seeking a reliable and sophisticated dictionary solution. With "Word Hunt," users can embark on an educational journey, expanding their vocabulary and gaining a deeper understanding of the English language.

In conclusion, "Word Hunt" is a cutting-edge web application that showcases the power of React.js, HTML, and CSS in creating a feature-rich dictionary. Its incorporation of text-to-speech functionality and status as a Progressive Web App underlines its commitment to user convenience and accessibility. Whether utilized for educational purposes, language enhancement, or casual word exploration, "Word Hunt" is certain to become an invaluable tool in the pursuit of linguistic knowledge.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
